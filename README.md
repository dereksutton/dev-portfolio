# My Developer Portfolio

## Project Description
The goal of this project was to build a clean, well-styled web page to showcase my personal web app projects, connect with other developers, and tell people a little bit about me. The page features an 'About Me', a 'Projects' section, and a footer with various links to connect with me online. I've also set media queries to make the design responsive to various viewport sizes.
